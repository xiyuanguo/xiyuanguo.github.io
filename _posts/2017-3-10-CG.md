In my opinion, the major aim of the computer graphics is to produce the desirable third dimension photos using the computer. Therefore, we should build up some geometrical presentation for the occasion of established graphics , and then use the certain sunlight model and calculate the sunlight effect under the supposed sunlight and the texture. As a result CG is tightly associated with the design of geometry. In fact, the technology to present the curve design is a feasible research content. At the same time, the results of calculating the three dimension graphics are shown as the digital imagines. Consequently, CG associate with picture process tightly as well.
